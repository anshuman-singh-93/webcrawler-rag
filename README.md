ðŸš€ Automated Web Content Search with LangChain, OpenAI, and FAISS

I recently built an end-to-end pipeline to automate crawling my website, processing the content, and enabling natural language search using cutting-edge tools like LangChain, OpenAI, and FAISS.

ðŸ”§ What I Did:
	â€¢	Crawled internal links using Python and BeautifulSoup to recursively gather all content from my website.
	â€¢	Loaded web pages with LangChainâ€™s WebBaseLoader.
	â€¢	Chunked the content using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for better processing.
	â€¢	Generated vector embeddings with OpenAI and stored them in a FAISS vector database for fast, similarity-based retrieval.
	â€¢	Built a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline using a GPT-4o LLM to answer natural language queries based on my siteâ€™s content.

Now, I can query my own website with natural language and get accurate, context-aware responses â€” unlocking powerful new ways to manage and search my content!
