ðŸš€ Built Something Amazing with LangChain, OpenAI, and FAISS! ðŸš€

Recently, I set out to automate the process of crawling my website, extracting all links, loading and chunking the content, and then making it searchable using state-of-the-art vector embeddings and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Hereâ€™s how I did it:

Used Python and BeautifulSoup to recursively crawl and collect all internal links from my site.
Leveraged LangChainâ€™s WebBaseLoader to fetch and load all the content.
Split the content into manageable chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
Created vector embeddings with OpenAI and stored them in a FAISS vector database for fast similarity search.
Built a retrieval chain with a GPT-4o LLM to answer questions based on my websiteâ€™s content!
Now, I can ask natural language questions and get context-aware answers from my own site. Super excited about the possibilities this unlocks for knowledge management and search!
