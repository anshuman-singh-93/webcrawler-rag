ðŸš€ Automated Web Content Search with LangChain, OpenAI, and FAISS

Built a Rag application to query and answer questions using content from my website.

ðŸ”§ What I Did:

Crawled internal links using Python and BeautifulSoup to recursively gather all content from my website.

Loaded web pages with LangChainâ€™s WebBaseLoader.

Chunked the content using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for better processing.

Generated vector embeddings with OpenAI and stored them in a FAISS vector database for fast, similarity-based retrieval.

Built a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline using a GPT-4o LLM to answer natural language queries based on my siteâ€™s content.

Now, I can query my own website with natural language and get accurate, context-aware responses â€” unlocking powerful new ways to manage and search my content!
